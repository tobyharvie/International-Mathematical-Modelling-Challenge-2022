# International-Mathematical-Modelling-Challenge-2022

In 2022, myself and a team of 3 others competed in the International Mathematical Modelling Challenge, a 5 day event in which the task was to evaluate the best methods for boarding and disembarking aircraft, a significant optimization problem in the aviation industry. For more details see the [problem statement](Problem-Sheet.pdf). We faced 57 other teams from 31 countries, and overall won the competition with an Outstanding Award.

My primary role in the project was to develop a stochastic [model](board.py) of plane boarding, which I wrote in Python. Note that due to the time-constrained nature of the competition the codebase may not follow all standard practices. My role also involved choosing, simulating, and investigating the efficacy of different boarding methods. My process and results are documented extensively in our [report](IMMC-Report.pdf) - see all sections on boarding (Sections 2, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 5.1, 6).

Edit: It appears that Git is not able to render our report. See it online instead [here](https://immchallenge.org/Contests/2022/papers/2022019.pdf).
